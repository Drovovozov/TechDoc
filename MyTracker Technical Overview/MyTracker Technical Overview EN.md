# MyTracker Technical Overview

## Tracking Code

MyTracker uses a tracking code to collect data about website or app visitors. The tracking code includes a JavaScript file hosted on MyTracker's servers, as well as 
a small piece of JavaScript code provided by MyTracker, which must be added to the HTML code of each page on the website or within the app. This code is responsible 
for collecting data on user behavior and sending  that data to MyTracker's servers for processing and storage. The tracking code is designed to be lightweight and 
unobtrusive, so it doesn't slow down the website or app's performance. When a user visits a website or opens an app that has the MyTracker tracking code implemented, 
the tracking code starts collecting data on various user events, such as page views, clicks, form submissions, and more. This data is then sent to MyTracker's servers 
where it is processed and stored.

## User Behavior Data Collection Techniques

MyTracker uses various techniques to collect data on user behavior, including:
- cookies
- local storage
- device fingerprinting

### Cookies

Cookies are small text files that are stored on the user's device when they visit a website. MyTracker uses cookies to retrieve data such as user preferences, login 
information, and website activity. This allows MyTracker to track user behavior across different sessions and devices, as long as the user remains logged in and doesn't 
clear their cookies.

### Local Storage

Local storage is similar to cookies in that it allows web applications to store data on a user's device. Local storage is not stored in a file like cookies are. 
Instead, local storage is implemented as a key-value store in the user's browser. This means that data is stored as key-value pairs in the browser's memory, with each 
key being a unique identifier for a specific piece of data, and the value being the actual data itself. The data in local storage is stored in a structured way, meaning 
that it is organized into different objects or arrays. These objects can be manipulated by the web application or the tracking code to store and retrieve data as needed. 
Local storage has a larger storage capacity compared to cookies, and the data is not sent to the server with every request. MyTracker uses local storage to store data 
about the user, such as their preferences and activities on the website or app. The tracking code on the website or app creates a local storage object and stores 
the data in it. The data can be accessed by the website or app and the tracking code on subsequent visits to personalize the user experience or track their behavior. 
Using local storage allows MyTracker to store larger amounts of data on the user's device, which can be useful for tracking user behavior or preferences that would 
exceed the storage capacity of cookies.

### Device Fingerprinting

Device fingerprinting is another technique used by MyTracker to identify and track users across different devices or browsers. It involves collecting information about 
a user's device, such as browser version, screen resolution, installed plugins, and other device-specific details that can be used to create a unique identifier, 
or fingerprint, for that device. MyTracker's tracking code collects this information and sends it to MyTracker's servers, where it is used to create a unique 
identifier for the user's device. This identifier is then associated with the user's account or profile, allowing MyTracker to track their behavior across multiple 
devices or browsers. Device fingerprinting can be useful for tracking users who clear their cookies or use multiple devices, as it allows MyTracker to identify them 
even if they are not logged in or using the same browser. Device fingerprinting enables MyTracker to track users who clear their cookies or use multiple devices, 
as it allows MyTracker to identify users even if they are not logged in or using the same browser. 

## Performance Tracking

In addition to tracking user behavior, MyTracker also allows to track the performance of marketing campaigns. This is done through the use of UTM parameters. 
UTM parameters are tags added to the end of a URL that allow website owners and marketers to track the effectiveness of their online campaigns. MyTracker can use 
UTM parameters to track the effectiveness of different marketing campaigns.

MyTracker also offers a range of other features, such as audience segmentation, conversion tracking, and ad campaign optimization. Audience segmentation allows 
businesses and marketers to group website or app visitors based on various criteria, such as demographics, behavior, and interests. Conversion tracking allows 
businesses and marketers to track specific user actions, such as form submissions, purchases, and sign-ups. Ad campaign optimization allows businesses and marketers 
to optimize their ad campaigns by tracking which ads are driving the most conversions and making data-driven decisions to improve their results.
